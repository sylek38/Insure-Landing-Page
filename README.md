## Insure-Landing-Page

The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible, trying not to use JavaScript.
Project challenge from: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW

I was taking this task to enhance my **Sass**, **RWD** + **BEM** skills, paying attention to **Accessibility**.

However, for accessibility reasons, I decided to break that "no JS rule" and do it the way that was right to me :thinking: without the checkbox + css method - using just a button + JS instead, as some JS should be added for changing ARIA attributes anyway.
